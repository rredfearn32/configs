# Robbie's Configs

A repo to hold all my transferable configs. The main branch holds the general configs for my personal use, while branches contain environment-specific configs.

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo anywhere on your system
2. Create a symlink of each config file here to the location they need to be

## Example

```
cd ~
git clone <this-repo>
rm .gitconfig
ln -s <this-repo>/.gitconfig .
```

## Configs added so far
